Problem 1: Small Calculator Using Class
Question: Create a small calculator that performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division using a class. The inputs should be:

a (double): The first number

b (double): The second number

operation (String): The type of operation (can be "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide")

Problem 2: Generate Odd Number Series
Question: With a single integer as the input, generate the following series until a = x:

Input: a = 1, then output: 1

Input: a = 2, then output: 1, 3

Input: a = 3, then output: 1, 3, 5

Input: a = 4, then output: 1, 3, 5, 7

Input: a = x, then output: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...

Problem 3: Generate Modified Odd Number Series
Question: With a single integer as the input, generate the following series until a = x:

Input: a = 1, then output: 1

Input: a = 2, then output: 1

Input: a = 3, then output: 1, 3, 5

Input: a = 4, then output: 1, 3, 5

Input: a = 5, then output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Input: a = 6, then output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Input: a = x, then output: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...

Problem 4: Count Multiples of Numbers from 1 to 9
Question: Get the total count of numbers listed in the dictionary which are multiples of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Input: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]

Output: {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
